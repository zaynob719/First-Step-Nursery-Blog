        <h2 class="corona">OUR RESPONSE TO THE CORONA VIRUS</h2>

    <p class="corona2"> 
        We are proud of our commitments and efforts towards making sure the nursery stays safe for our staff and children. The nursery has remained open through out the first lockdown to facilitate a place for children of 'Key worker' parents and for anyone that needed our service. Following the governmrnt guidelines relating to the second national lockdown we can guarantee that we will remain open to provide the very best service to the children. This will remain like so until further notice. 
        You might ask how has First Step kept up quality service in this trying times?
        Well we have implemented new and effective guidelines which are always advancing. </p>
        <p>1) We regularly sanitise all toys and used surfaces. </p>
        <p> 2) The children are kept in designated bubbles. This is done to minimise a potential spead of the Virus.</p>
        <p> 3) Our staffs have kept social distancing with parents by utitilising the <a href="#" class="family app"></a>Family.app to write feedback. This minimise the need for oral feedback.</p> 
        <p> 4) Parents are no longer allowed in the nursery to drop off or collect children and all view-ins are booked for the evening when all the children have left nursery.</p>
        <p>5) All our staffs wear masks when talking to parents and we require parents to do the same</p>
        <p>6) We require staffs to keep social distancing in their breaks and whenever possible.</p>
        <p>7)If any child has a high tempreture or a new continuous cought they will be required to be taken out of the rooms and possibly be taken back home.</p>
        <p>8) Tempretures for staffs and children are taken every day at the entrance of the nursery to make sure that everyone in the nursery safe. </p>

<img src="images/bonfire2.jpg" height="250px" width="600px" alt="Bonfire night ">
<h5> Did you know that:</h5>
    <P> Guy Fawkes Night also known as Bonfire Night is an annual commemoration observed in the United Kingdom. To celebrate that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London. Months later the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure. 
    On this day many people light Bonfires and set off fireworks to create beautiful colours in the sky. </P>
    <P> We will encourage kids to make Bonfire Night-inspired art with bright colourful paint, to listen to the sounds and express how it makes them feel. </P>
